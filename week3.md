Entry: #061424

Alright this week is a bit much but I will keep it as brief (and professional) as possible. This week, our goal was to research, study, and impliment HSV color detection, and bounding boxes. I've only completed the first part of that goal unfortunately. I've found great progress in learning the foundations of HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) values and the operations of the digital colorspace. On the contrary, these set of challenges have taken the majority of my time this week and I am unable to complete the other half on the deadline. However, these challenges have been overcome and the next series of tasks should come and go smoothly. Wrestling with Python has now become a nusiance, but at least it's just that: a NUSIEANCE. The calling of methods, syntax, and formatting has been gotten used to and it would be more advanced techniques that would retard my ascent into "slightly above average" status. Other than those problems, my week has been great. I made progress, collaborated with my teammates, and learned somethong new every step of the way. That is why I joined this internship and I've been reminded of that today.

This is Elijah McClary, signing off for week three!

Ciao!
