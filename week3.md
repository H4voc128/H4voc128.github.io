Alright this week is a bit much but I will keep it as brief (and professional) as possible. This week, our goal was to research, study, and impliment HSV color detection, and bounding boxes. I've only completed the first part of that goal unfortunately. I've found great progress in learning the foundations of HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) values and the operations of the digital colorspace. On the contrary, these set of challenges have taken the majority of my time this week and I am unable to complete the other half on the deadline. 

This is Elijah McClary, signing off for week two!
