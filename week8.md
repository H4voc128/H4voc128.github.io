IT FINALLY HAPPENED!!! My code failed at my team meeting and quite dramatically I might add. Red light running (RLR) is a very persistant problem and it doesn't help that we Record an advertisement for our Final Project Presentation this week. While burning the midnight oil throughout the week I've scrapped the RLR detection code around 13 times in favor of a new solution. Then it hit me: "Why not give the code a form of short term memory to ensure the cars obeying the law and the ones that aren't are remembered until the light changes color?". And that is what I sought out to do. And with a few new arrays and a brand new method, RLR detection works without issue for many instances at a time (YESSSS)! I believe the recorded video for the presentation went well. It's purpose was to tease the audience as to what our project can accomplish. We went down to the "safest crossing on Morgan's campus" and gave examples of jaywalking and what it looks like to follow the law. Then, we went back the lab to record. I recorded my scene and voiceover after recording my other two lab mates for the video. I worked on timing the audio with the video and the effects until 7:58. Apparently if you open the submission file at a time before the due time, and not close it even well after, the website believes that you submitted the file at the time of the site opening. Saved my LIFE.

This is it for week 8!

I'ma take a long nap this weekend!
