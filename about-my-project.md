## About My Project

CodeName: "Traffic Hawk"
- An AI-Powered Traffic Obervation Pipeline

Problem: There is a lack of reasearch focusing on exploring ways AI and machine learning could be integrated into existing traffic monitoring systems.

Approach: During this project, I will assist a team in designing a system that accomplishes the following:

  - Detects pedestrians, vehicles (of different types), and other things found in traffic.
  - Recogonizes traffic violations such as jay walking, red light running, etc.
  - (Optional) Calculates the speed of target vehicles and determines speeding
  - (Optional) Reads license plates

Expected Outcome: In all honesty, I just expect this project to get done. If it ends up going somewhere big that is a plus, but I really want to just have fun with this.
