Entry: #070124

This week has been very eventful! I've managed to implement all techniques learned throughout my time here and I've FINALLY caught up with the rest of my team. Ms. Tasmeer has been sick for most of this week so tasks haven't been abundant. So me and my team (minus one - he is at a conference) have been doing auxilliary research on not only the roles in software, but the roles in hardware as well. Specifically: the GPU module. I've built a PC before so the basics are out of the way but I had yet to understand the difference between a CPU and a GPU. To understand the GPU I had to learn and cross-research about all hardware on a computer. From the motherboard, to the SSD, to the RAM, CPU, and finally GPU. Throughout my research I've come up with this system: 
A CPU to a motherboard is an engineer to a workshop. The engineer (CPU) is a very powerful and versatile piece of kit but can only handle one task at a time. The motherboard is the workshop in which the engineer (CPU) works and resides. The higher the quality of motherboard, the more optimized the "workshop" is. RAM is the workbench of the computer. Any tools (information) that the engineer (CPU) would need for a project goes on this table. The SSD or "solid-state-drive" is the long term storage of this workshop; like a garage if you will. The more space in the drive(s), the more space in the garage. Now for the GPU. Adding a GPU to a computer is like adding 3D printerss to the workshop. Though the CPU can get the tasks done, the GPU can handle all of these tasks at the same time. Like a 3D printing rack is to an engineer. The engineer can indeed build a model rocket given the time, but with a 3d printing rack, the engineer could build 50 in the time it takes to make 1.

This is my week 5 report!
