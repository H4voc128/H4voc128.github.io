Entry: #070524

This week was a little less productive than the last due to both being down a member of my group (due to sickness) and the cancellation of my mid-summer presentation (which we spent half the week preparing for). Ultimately we settled and managed to get the red light violations coded in for one street. Monday and tuesday was mostly preparing us for wednsday presentation. Wednsday was cancelled but we still had lab work despite the lack of members, tasks, and general lack of unorganization. 
Thurdsay was July the 4th (FREEDOM DAY!!!) and Friday we finally organized and got our job done for the week. They let us out of the labs early due to the lack of attendance on both the students' and mentors' part. 

This is the summary of this week's events

Au revoir!
