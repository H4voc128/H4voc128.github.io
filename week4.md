Entry: #062124

This week I haven't done much due to field trips and Juneteenth, so this entry will be the most brief compared to the others. This week I've managed to integrate several techniques and tools utilized in the previous weeks into one file. Not all at once unfortunately, but several together accross multiple files. Next week I'll have to really kick it into gear if I even hope of pulling this off. Man, this report WAS brief.

This is the end of my fourth report!
