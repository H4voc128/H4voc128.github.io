Entry: #070624

Greetings again! I see you've been SO entertained by my first entry that you've decided to continue reading and I thank you. Jokes aside, I do have a report to get to. During this week my knowledge of both AI and the Python language grew four-fold. Leagues ahead of week 1! During this week I have had some hiccups like adapting my Java knowledge into Python, and (practically) taming both the computer vision software (OpenCV) and YOLO ("You Only Look Once" an object detection software). However, once I got control of the reigns the rest of the week went smoothly. I successfully mananged to read video with OpenCV this week and am in the process of expanding my object detction knowledge and techniques through YOLO. It is a shame that we were down a member this week but it provided me the opportununity to expand my knowledge more than if the team was whole. A blessing in disguise, and for that I am grateful. 

This is Elijah McClary, signing off for week two!
