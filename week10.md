Entry: #080124

This week Has been a very short one but there was so much going on. The final presentation went off without a sitch. We are working on our final papers, and I have personal/work affairs to get in order. As of the time I am writing this my team and I are working hard on our final technical paper. Hopefully all goes well with the associates that I've made over the period of this internship.

This is the final SEAMLS blog entry...

This is Elijah McClary signing off!
Godspeed!
