## About Me
Currently, I am a Sophomore at Morgan State University, located in Baltimore, Maryland. I am pursuing a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Electrical Engineering. My expected graduation date is in 2027. My hobbies are games, tinkering, reading, 3d printing/modeling, and (graphic) art. I like music (forget "like" I ADORE music), fantasy novels, winter, food, etc. I dislike liars (heavily), boar-headedness, laziness, irrationality, and inefficiency.
