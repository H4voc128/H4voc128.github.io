During the first week, I met with my grad mentor, Ms. Tasmeen, and the rest of my team. This week consisted of workshops and team building exercises to prime us for the week ahead. These included spaghetti arcitecture, lab tours, and crash courses on the topics of python fundamentals, github, NumPy, and "Pandas" (whatever that's supposed to stand for).
