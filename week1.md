During the first week, I met with my grad mentor, Ms. Tasmeen, and the rest of my team. This week consisted of workshops and team building exercises to prime us for the week ahead. These included spaghetti arcitecture, lab tours, and crash courses on the topics of python fundamentals, github, NumPy, and "Pandas" (whatever that's supposed to stand for). So far, no original code or algoritms. It has been more copying what the instructors do on the board (not this blog of course) and breaking down the processes. I achieved in integrating myself in the social circles of two individuals: Tomi, a computer science major and a very smart young woman; and Ms. Tasmeen, an industry-driven, computer science encyclopedia of a newly-birthed mother. These two give me insight to how much I am going to enjoy this intership experience as well as the challenges ahead. My overall internship supervisor, Ms. Naja Mack, has been pretty chill on the day of my brother's graduation and for that I am very grateful. Well this is it for the first week, the next few weeks might have around he same length of this one but once my project start to take off these blogs should become more elaborate. 

This is Elijah McClary, signing off for week one!
