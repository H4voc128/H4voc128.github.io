During the first week, I met with my grad mentor, Ms. Tasmeen, and the rest of my team. This week consisted of workshops and team building exercises to prime us for the week ahead. These included spaghetti arcitecture, lab tours, and crash courses on the topics of python fundamentals, github, NumPy, and "Pandas" (whatever that's supposed to stand for). So far, no original code or algoritms. It has been more copying what the instructors do on the board (not this blog of course) and breaking down the processes. I achieved in integratingmyself in the social circles of two individuals: Tomi, a computer science major and a very smart young woman; and Ms. Tasmeen, an industry-driven, computer science encyclopedia of a newly-birthed mother.
