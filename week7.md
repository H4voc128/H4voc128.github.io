Entry: #071224

We officially made it past the halfway point of the internship! Throughout week seven I made it a mission to implement red light violations and jaywalking detection for BOTH sides of the street. Through sleepless nights and LOTS of caffine, I have succeeded in creating a new framework for both red light running and jaywalking in a single instance. The jaywalking code already worked flawlessly so I was scared to touch it to be honest. But the red light violation detection secment of my code got a total rework. Now that I have this segment FINALLY out of the way, I can focus on debugging my code to ensure it doesn't fail in front of (around) a hundred people on presentation day. It is an unwritten rule in this universe I guess, things work fine until there are witnesses, like Schrodinger's cat, but with a VENGANCE!

This is my Week 7 report!

Until next week!!!
